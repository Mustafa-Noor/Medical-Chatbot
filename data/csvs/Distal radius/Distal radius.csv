The joint is stabilized by three sets of ligaments: 1. lateral ligament complex, 2. medial deltoid ligament, 3. distal tibiofibular syndesmosis ligaments.","What are the three main ligamentous structures supporting the ankle?","The ankle joint is stabilized by the lateral ligament complex, the medial deltoid ligament, and the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis ligaments.","ankle joint, talocrural joint, hinge-type synovial joint, tibia, fibula, talus, stabilizing ligaments, lateral ligament complex, medial deltoid ligament, distal tibiofibular syndesmosis"
Anatomy of the ankle joint,Lateral Ligament Complex,"What are the components of the lateral ligament complex?","The lateral ligament complex originates from the lateral malleolus and consists of three distinct and separate ligaments: the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL), and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL).","What are the three ligaments of the lateral ankle?","The lateral ankle ligaments are the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL), and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL).","lateral ligament complex, lateral malleolus, anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL), calcaneofibular ligament (CFL)"

Anatomy of the ankle joint,Distal Tibiofibular Syndesmosis,"What ligaments form the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis?","The distal tibiofibular syndesmosis is formed by three major ligaments: the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL), and interosseous tibiofibular ligament (ITFL).","What ligaments constitute the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis?","The syndesmosis is formed by the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL), and interosseous tibiofibular ligament (ITFL).","distal tibiofibular syndesmosis, anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL), posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL), interosseous tibiofibular ligament (ITFL)"
Pathophysiology,Low ankle sprains,"What is the most common mechanism of ankle injury?","The most common mechanism of ankle injury is ankle inversion, which stresses the lateral ligament complex, particularly the ATFL (anterior talofibular ligament). This typically involves plantar flexion and inversion.","How do low ankle sprains typically occur?","Low ankle sprains usually result from inversion, primarily involving plantar flexion and inversion, affecting the ATFL.","low ankle sprains, common mechanism, inversion, lateral ligament complex, ATFL, plantar flexion"
Pathophysiology,High ankle sprains,"What are high ankle sprains?","Injuries to the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis are known as 'high ankle sprains,' are less common, and typically result from external rotation and/or ankle dorsiflexion, considered high-energy injuries.","What causes high ankle sprains?","High ankle sprains are caused by external rotation and/or ankle dorsiflexion, representing high-energy injuries.","high ankle sprains, distal tibiofibular syndesmosis, less common, external rotation, ankle dorsiflexion"
Risk Factors,Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors,"What factors increase the risk of ankle sprains?","Risk factors include modifiable intrinsic factors (limited ROM, reduced proprioception, high BMI), non-modifiable intrinsic factors (female sex, previous injury history), modifiable extrinsic factors (sport type, high heels), and non-modifiable extrinsic factors (male athletes).","What are considered intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for ankle sprains?","Intrinsic factors include modifiable (ROM, proprioception, BMI) and non-modifiable (sex, injury history).

Risk Factors,Prognostic Factors,"What factors are associated with good outcomes after an ankle sprain?","Good outcomes are linked to being young, having a low-grade injury, and a low activity level. Poor outcomes are associated with systemic joint laxity, limb/foot malalignment, and previous injury. Ankle joint shape, alignment, and congruence can also affect stability.","What factors predict a positive outcome after an ankle sprain?","Younger age, low-grade injuries, and low activity levels are associated with good outcomes, while joint laxity, malalignment, and prior injury predict poorer outcomes.","prognostic factors, good outcomes, poor outcomes, young age, low-grade injury, low activity level, systemic joint laxity, limb malalignment, previous injury"
Assessment,History and Physical Examination,"What is crucial for assessing an ankle sprain?","History and physical examination are crucial, including mechanism of injury, weight-bearing status, previous trauma, site of swelling/bruising/pain, range of movement, and specific ligament tests (anterior drawer, varus tilt, squeeze, external rotation).","What information is gathered during assessment?","Key assessment components include injury history, physical examination of swelling/pain/ROM, and specific ligament tests.","assessment, history, physical examination, mechanism of injury, weight-bearing status, previous trauma, swelling, bruising, pain, range of movement, anterior drawer test, varus tilt test, squeeze test, external rotation test"
Assessment,Imaging,"What imaging is used for acute ankle sprains?","The Ottawa Ankle rules determine the need for radiographs. Weight-bearing ankle radiographs (AP, mortise, lateral views) are the first choice. CT is useful for detecting associated fractures, while MRI is superior for confirming syndesmotic injuries and ruling out osteochondral lesions.","What imaging is typically used for ankle injuries?","Initial imaging includes weight-bearing radiographs (AP, mortise, lateral views). CT may detect associated fractures, and MRI is best for syndesmotic injuries and osteochondral lesions.","imaging, Ottawa Ankle rules, radiographs, weight-bearing (WB) radiographs, anteroposterior (AP), mortise, lateral views, CT scan, MRI scan, syndesmotic injuries, osteochondral lesions"
Assessment,Differential Diagnosis,"What conditions should be considered when diagnosing an ankle sprain?","Subtalar instability is the most common differential diagnosis to exclude, as it can be difficult to differentiate from lateral ankle instability acutely. Pseudo-instability, the sensation of giving way with pain, should also be differentiated from true instability.","What other conditions might mimic an ankle sprain?","Subtalar instability and pseudo-instability (feeling of giving way with pain) are key differentials to consider.","differential diagnosis, subtalar instability, lateral ankle instability, pseudo-instability, true instability"
Management,Classification,"How are ankle ligamentous injuries classified?","Ankle ligamentous injuries are classified by grade: Grade I (minimal tenderness/swelling), Grade II (moderate tenderness/swelling/instability), and Grade III (significant tenderness/swelling/instability).","What are the different grades of ankle ligamentous injuries?","Injuries are graded from I (minimal) to III (significant), based on tenderness, swelling, and instability.","classification, ankle ligamentous injuries, Grade I, Grade II, Grade III"
Management,Initial Management,"What is the initial management for an ankle sprain?","The initial management within the first 72 hours includes the PRICE protocol (protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation).

Introduction,Prevalence and Demographics,"What is the incidence of ankle sprains?","Ankle sprains are very common musculoskeletal injuries. Incidence is highest in males aged 10-19, but women over 30 sustain more sprains than men in that age group.
