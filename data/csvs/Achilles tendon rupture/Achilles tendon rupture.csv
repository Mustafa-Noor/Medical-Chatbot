Causes of Achilles Tendon Rupture,Mechanisms and Risk Factors,"What causes an Achilles tendon to rupture?","The Achilles tendon can rupture without warning or more commonly during sports involving sudden stops and starts. Falls and trips can also cause it. Weakness due to medical conditions or medications increases risk. Long-term tendon problems are also a factor.","What are the common causes and risk factors for this injury?","Common causes include sports requiring quick changes in direction, falls, tendon weakness from medical conditions, medications, or tendinopathies.","Achilles tendon rupture causes, sports activities, sudden stops and starts, falls, slips, tendon weakness, medical conditions, diabetes, medications, steroids, antibiotics, tendinopathies"

Causes of Achilles Tendon Rupture,Mechanisms and Risk Factors,"What causes an Achilles tendon to rupture?","The Achilles tendon can rupture without warning or more commonly during sports involving sudden stops and starts. Falls and trips can also cause it. Weakness due to medical conditions or medications increases risk. Long-term tendon problems are also a factor.","What are the common causes and risk factors for this injury?","Common causes include sports requiring quick changes in direction, falls, tendon weakness from medical conditions, medications, or tendinopathies.","Achilles tendon rupture causes, sports activities, sudden stops and starts, falls, slips, tendon weakness, medical conditions, diabetes, medications, steroids, antibiotics, tendinopathies"
