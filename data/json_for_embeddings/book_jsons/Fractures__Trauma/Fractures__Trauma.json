      "text": "The proximal humerus has a head retroverted 30 degrees relative to the transepicondylar axis. The head height is approximately 5.6 cm above the superior border of the pectoralis major tendon, which is important for arthroplasty. The anatomic neck is directly below the humeral head and serves as the attachment for the shoulder capsule, while the surgical neck is more distal and more often involved in fractures."

      "text": "The proximal humerus is the most proximal bone of the upper extremity and has a head retroverted 30 degrees relative to the transepicondylar axis. The head height is approximately 5.6 cm above the superior border of the pectoralis major tendon. The surgical neck is more distal and more often involved in fractures. These injuries can be associated with rotator cuff tears, axillary nerve palsy, brachial plexus palsy, and axillary artery injury."

Treatment options range from nonoperative management to IM nailing, MIPO, or arthroplasty (hemiarthroplasty or reverse shoulder arthroplasty), with implant choice depending on fracture pattern, bone quality, and patient factors."

      "topic": "Calcaneus",
      "text": "Calcaneal fractures typically result from high-energy axial loading, such as falls from height or motor vehicle crashes, and are often associated with other injuries. Diagnosis relies on plain radiographs (AP, lateral, mortise views) to assess fracture patterns like tongue-type versus joint depression, and importantly, BÃ¶hler's angle and the talocrural angle. CT scans are crucial for detailed evaluation of articular involvement and comminution, guiding surgical planning. Management varies from nonoperative treatment for stable fractures to open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for displaced intra-articular fractures, often using lateral approaches and plates or screws, with careful attention to soft-tissue viability and the heel pad. Postoperative care emphasizes swelling reduction and protected weight-bearing."

      "topic": "Bone Healing",
      "text": "Perrenâ€TMs Strain Theory posits that fracture healing tissue type is dictated by interfragmentary strain. Too little strain leads to non-union, while too much strain impairs hard callus formation and can cause hypertrophic non-union or pseudoarthrosis. Adverse effects on healing include compromised blood supply, smoking, NSAIDs, and head injury."
