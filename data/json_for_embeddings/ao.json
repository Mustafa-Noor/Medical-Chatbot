"topic": "Diaphyseal Fractures: Functional Considerations",
"text": "The diaphysis of long bones maintains joint relationships and provides muscle attachments for limb movement. Restoration of length, axial alignment, and rotation is crucial, but anatomical reduction of every fragment is not always necessary for normal function. While some shortening or minor angular deformities may be tolerated, significant malalignment, especially in weight-bearing joints, can lead to abnormal stresses and post-traumatic arthritis. Humeral shaft fractures generally tolerate more deformity due to the shoulder's range of motion, unlike forearm fractures which require precise reduction for radioulnar joint function."

{
"topic": "Diaphyseal Fractures: Mechanism of Injury",
"text": "Diaphyseal fractures result from direct or indirect forces. Indirect trauma typically involves less energy and causes less displacement and soft-tissue damage, often resulting in spiral or transverse fractures. Direct forces, especially high-energy impacts, cause more displacement, fragmentation, and soft-tissue injury, leading to complex fracture patterns. The fracture pattern and displacement are good indicators of the associated soft-tissue damage and influence the timing and approach of surgical management."

{
"topic": "Diaphyseal Fractures: Initial Evaluation",
"text": "Initial evaluation of a diaphyseal fracture requires a thorough history of the injury mechanism, assessment of patient status (polytrauma, comorbidities), and a systematic physical examination. Crucially, neurovascular status distal to the injury must be assessed and documented, as arterial injury or compartment syndrome requires emergency management. X-rays are the mainstay of diagnosis, providing information on fracture pattern, displacement, and associated soft-tissue injury, though CT may be needed for complex articular extensions."

{
"topic": "Diaphyseal Fractures: Fixation Techniques",
"text": "Common fixation techniques for diaphyseal fractures include intramedullary (IM) nailing (load-sharing, allows early weight-bearing), plating (direct or indirect reduction, absolute or relative stability), and external fixation (temporary or definitive, especially for severe soft-tissue injuries). Locking plates offer enhanced stability, particularly in osteoporotic bone and metaphyseal extensions. The choice of fixation depends on fracture pattern, soft-tissue condition, bone quality, and surgeon expertise."

{
"topic": "Closed Skin Degloving Injury",
"text": "Closed skin degloving occurs when shear forces separate the skin from the underlying fascia without an external wound. A resulting cavity fills with fluid or hematoma, compromising dermal vascularity and sensation. This injury is characterized by a 'slippery' feel to the skin. Treatment involves emergent drainage and a pressure dressing, sometimes with a progressive drain removal, to promote adherence and healing. If the skin is breached, it's an open degloving injury and managed as an open fracture."

"topic": "Compartment Syndrome Pathophysiology",
"text": "Compartment syndrome arises from increased pressure within a fascial or osteofascial space, exceeding critical microvascular perfusion pressure (MPP). This is caused by endogenous factors (hemorrhage, edema) or exogenous pressure (restrictive casts). If sustained, it leads to neuromuscular dysfunction, hypoxia, anaerobic metabolism, muscle necrosis, and potentially amputation. MPP is determined by diastolic blood pressure minus intramuscular pressure; a difference <30 mmHg indicates hypoxia."

"topic": "Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis of Compartment Syndrome",
"text": "Compartment syndrome presents with unrelenting ischemic pain, numbness, tingling, and tense swelling. Motor weakness is a late sign, and pulses may remain palpable. In unconscious patients, unexplained tachycardia or high lactate levels can be indicators. Diagnosis relies on high clinical suspicion, as analgesics can mask symptoms. Tissue pressure measurements (infusion, wick, stick, or transducer techniques) are vital, especially when clinical assessment is unreliable, to diagnose impending or established compartment syndrome and guide urgent decompression."
},
{
"topic": "Management of Compartment Syndrome",
"text": "Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency requiring immediate treatment. Initial measures include releasing constrictive dressings and elevating the limb. Definitive treatment is dermatofasciotomy to decompress the affected compartments. In trauma, percutaneous fasciotomy is not indicated if the skin is intact. For all affected compartments, regardless of location, complete release is mandatory. Delayed closure or skin grafting may be required for tension-free wound closure."
