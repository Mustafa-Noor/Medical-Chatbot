    "text": "DDH is a developmental condition occurring after birth, affecting 1 in 1000 live births, predominantly in females (80%) and often involving the left hip (60%). Risk factors include genetic predisposition, intrauterine crowding (breech presentation, oligohydramnios, twins), and neuromuscular conditions. Pathophysiology involves a shallow acetabulum and femoral anteversion, leading to abnormal enclavement of the femoral head. Clinical diagnosis relies on leg length assessment, range of motion, and specific tests like Barlow's and Ortolani's. Imaging includes ultrasound (for infants <4 months) and X-rays (once the femoral head ossifies), assessing parameters like Graf angles, Perkins line, Shenton's line, acetabular index, and Center Edge (CE) angle."

For irreducible hips, failed closed treatment, or very narrow safe zones, open reduction with or without adductor tenotomy and hip spica casting is performed. For older children (4 months to 8 years), open reduction and spica casting are primary, often requiring femoral or pelvic osteotomies if reduction is under tension or the dysplasia is severe.

Contraindications include severe crush injuries, compartment syndrome, sickle cell disease, and relative contraindications for PVD. Nerve injury is typically due to direct compression at the cuff edge, not ischemia. Proper cuff width and pressure are crucial to minimize risk, with lower pressures achieved by gradually increasing pressure until distal pulse is lost. Limb exanguination is effective but contraindicated in infection, metastatic disease, or venous thrombosis. Tourniquet use should be limited in duration (ideally <2 hours) to minimize complications like neuropraxia and muscle ischemia."

{
"topic": "Bone Healing Phases",
"text": "Bone healing progresses through distinct phases: Hematoma formation (hours) initiates the inflammatory response with growth factors attracting cells. Inflammation (1 week) involves macrophages and osteoclasts clearing debris and activating growth factors. Soft callus formation (1-4 weeks) involves fibroblasts laying down type 3 collagen and chondroblasts forming type 2 cartilage. Hard callus (4-16 weeks) replaces cartilage with woven bone, stabilizing the fracture. Remodeling (years) reshapes the bone to mature lamellar bone according to Wolff's law."

{
"topic": "Composition of Articular Cartilage",
"text": "Articular cartilage is composed of chondrocytes (2% by weight) within an extracellular matrix (80% wet weight). The matrix consists of collagen (90% type II, with types VI, X, XI), proteoglycans (10%, responsible for tensile strength and water attraction), and other proteins like MMPs and elastin. Water content is high (70%), contributing to its viscoelastic properties."

{
"topic": "Articular Cartilage Changes with Age and Osteoarthritis",
"text": "With aging, articular cartilage shows decreased water content, collagen concentration, and proteoglycan content, alongside increased chondrocyte size and stiffness. Osteoarthritis (OA) involves further proteoglycan degradation, increased water content, altered chondrocyte activity, and eventual cartilage breakdown, leading to fibrillation and bone exposure."

"topic": "Biologic Changes After Nerve Injury",
"text": "Following nerve injury, proximal axon atrophy and cell body changes (chromatolysis) occur, promoting regeneration. Distally, Wallerian degeneration affects the axon and myelin, while Schwann cells proliferate to form 'bands of Büngner' guiding axonal sprouts. Motor end plates degenerate over time, necessitating re-innervation within months for functional recovery."

{
"topic": "Pathologic Process of Osteoarthritis",
"text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) begins with mechanical disruption of the collagen network and increased water content in cartilage (Stage 1). This alters cartilage metabolism, favoring catabolic processes and releasing degradation products (Stage 2). An inflammatory response ensues (Stage 3), mediated by cytokines and MMPs, further degrading the matrix (Stage 4) and leading to characteristic histological changes like fibrillation and chondrocyte loss (Stage 5)."
