It arises from plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to abnormal protein production, osteoblast inhibition, and osteoclast stimulation. Clinical features include bone pain, pathologic fractures (especially spinal), renal failure, and hypercalcemia. Imaging reveals punched-out lytic lesions with no sclerotic rim, a 'pepper pot' skull appearance, and multi-site involvement. Bone scans are typically negative due to osteoblast inactivation."

CT scans are crucial for detailed evaluation of articular involvement and comminution, guiding surgical planning. Management varies from nonoperative treatment for stable fractures to open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for displaced intra-articular fractures, often using lateral approaches and plates or screws, with careful attention to soft-tissue viability and the heel pad.
