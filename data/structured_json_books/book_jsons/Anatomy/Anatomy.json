Lumbar pedicles are shorter and wider than thoracic pedicles, reflecting the biomechanical loads they support and influencing the choice and trajectory of pedicle screws during spinal fusion."

      "topic": "Differences Between Tendons and Ligaments",
      "text": "Tendons and ligaments differ in composition and function. Ligaments have higher elastin content for recoil and are weaker, with layered fibers. Tendons are stronger, have less elastin, longitudinal fibers, and receive vascular supply via paratenon or vinculae, enabling efficient transmission of muscle forces to bone. Both are composed primarily of Type I collagen and proteoglycans."
