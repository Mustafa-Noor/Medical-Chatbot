It is these features that account for the increased propensity of delayed union/non-union in the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction, and additionally, the stresses exerted at the mobile metatarsal head, which are directed to the base, using the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction as a fulcrum (8). Additionally, two sesamoid bones, the os peroneum (inside the peroneus longus tendon) and os vesalianum (just proximal to the fifth metatarsal base), should be differentiated from fractures, having a smooth contour (9). Most importantly, there is a watershed area at the metaphysis-diaphysis junction between the proximal metaphyseal blood supply and the diaphyseal part of the bone supplied by the nutrient artery which is greatly responsible for the highest risk of delayed union/non-union of these fractures (10, 11) (Fig. 2). Finally, the sural nerve is very close to the entry point for intramedullary screw fixation and should be identified and protected during reconstructive procedures (12)."

Inversion injuries are responsible for tuberosity avulsion fractures (14), where peroneus brevis is already contracted during stance phase and has the potential of pulling the tuberosity fragment when the plantarly flexed foot is subjected to an inversion stress; the firm attachment of the lateral band of plantar aponeurosis, on the other hand, is implicated for fractures distally to the tuberosity (15, 16, 17, 18). Furthermore, Gu used a three-dimensional model to study stress loads on the metatarsals during landing, reporting that one of the peak stress points was in the proximal fifth metatarsal. When he changed the angle of landing, he noticed that the lateral metatarsal stress surged during inversion (19)."

Athletes who encounter a Jones fracture apply increased forces at the base of the fifth metatarsal during common sports activities (21). There are many predisposing biomechanical factors which can shift weight to the lateral foot and cause a Zone 2 or Zone 3 fifth metatarsal fracture. In a cadaveric study, Aronow et al. demonstrated that isolated gastrocnemius or triceps surae contractures transmit weight-bearing forces from the hindfoot to the midfoot and forefoot (22). Congenital bone malstructure such as plantar malunion of fifth metatarsal or dorsal malunion of any of the first four metatarsals can also provoke relative plantarflexion of fifth metatarsal's head and cause a shear force carried by the fifth metatarsal. Obese patients are more prone to Zone 3 fractures due to secondary biomechanical and metabolic consequences of excessive adipose tissue (23). A recent radiographic analysis of 51 NFL players showed that a long, straight, narrow fifth metatarsal possesses a greater risk for Jones fracture (24). Tibia vara, varus hindfoot (25), forefoot adduction (26), genu varum heel (14), and metatarsus adductus (27) have also been associated with increased load to the lateral column."

They usually occur as inversion injuries, secondary to the pull of the lateral band of plantar fascia and peroneus brevis tendon.\nZone 2: Fractures of the metaphyseal-/diaphyseal junction, which extend into the fourth-fifth intermetatarsal facet, distal to the articulation between cuboid and fifth metatarsal base ('Jones' fractures). They occur after indirect adduction force to the fifth metatarsal, distal to the tuberosity and along with ankle plantarflexion. This foot twisting creates a pulling force on the lateral band of the plantar fascia, with tension and strain on peroneus brevis tendon.\nZone 3: Proximal diaphyseal stress fractures, typically located distal to the Lisfranc joint and distal to the fourth-fifth intermetatarsal facet, that is in the proximal 1.5 cm of the metatarsal shaft. They occur from chronic repetitive stress in sports like running, soccer, and basketball or from certain biomechanical abnormalities such as the case of a cavovarus foot, varus tibia, and recent augmentation of weight-bearing activity. Microfractures of the lateral cortex are initiated by tensile forces; subsequently, the fracture propagates medially.\nFractures occurring at the regions distal to Zone 3 are termed as 'Dancer's fractures'. They are typically spiral fractures occurring from rotational forces to the axially loaded, plantarflexed foot. In addition, fractures of fifth metatarsal's head can be intra-articular or extra-articular."

These three types need adjusted management strategies and help the physician to determine the age of the fracture at presentation:\nType 1 (acute): Fractures characterized by a narrow fracture line, no intramedullary sclerosis, minimal cortical hypertrophy, or periosteal reaction with no history of previous fracture (previous discomfort or even pain may be present).\nType II (delayed union): Increased fracture line width, involving both cortices, associated periosteal bone and intramedullary sclerosis, with a history of previous injury or fracture.\nType III (non-union): Eradication of the medullary canal by sclerotic bone, evidence of periosteal reaction and radiolucency, typically associated with a history of repetitive trauma and recurrent symptoms."

On the contrary, patients presenting with stress reactions or fractures complain about pain only during activity in the prodromal phase, with these symptoms commonly being present for several weeks (29, 36). Generally, patients are able to localize the pain to the area of the fracture, while foot inversion from 30 to 50° results in maximal strain and increased symptoms. Note that there is very limited mobility at the fracture site and therefore absence of crepitus or palpable gap."

A foot injury requires radiographic evaluation if the patient has pain in the midfoot and if any of the following is present, bony tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal, bony tenderness at the navicular, and inability to bear weight taking four steps both immediately and in the emergency room. The reported sensitivity and specificity of these rules are 100 and 70%, respectively (38).\nThree standard, weight-bearing views are necessary, anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and 30- or 45-degree oblique view, with the latter being the most helpful for the anatomic classification. If the patient cannot tolerate pain with weight-bearing, mild supination can be added to the lateral view in order to minimize osseous overlap. Yet, as much as 77% of avulsion fractures (particularly those at the tip of the tuberosity) may be missed on standard foot radiographs (39), and a supplementary AP view of the ankle including the base of the proximal fifth metatarsal should be obtained (40)."

    "text": "Dameron (71) was the first to report clinical healing as high as 97% of tuberosity fractures, within weeks from injury; other teams have also reported equivalent results (30, 35, 72). There is a general agreement that all non-displaced or minimally displaced tuberosity avulsion fractures should be treated conservatively; a systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in union and refracture rates between different conservative methods (73). Elastic wrapping and weight-bearing as tolerated for a period of 3 weeks is adequate (74) and a hard-sole shoe, short-leg cast, or cam walker boot can also be other options (51, 52, 75). Historically, surgery was recommended for a displacement greater than 2 mm, or comminution in Zone 1 fractures and various operative interventions have been described (76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81). A prospective study showed no benefit of immobilization vs symptomatic treatment for avulsion fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal (48), while a recent systematic review opted for non-operative treatment, regardless of technique (82). Involvement of more than one-third of the cubometatarsal joint may require open reduction and screw fixation using tension band wiring or a small fragment screw (2.0-2.7 mm) (40, 83, 84); however, the latter is found to be superior (83). A distal ulna hook plate was used with good results for displaced tuberosity avulsion fractures (85). A recent study showed that clinical and radiologic outcomes of operative vs non-operative management of Zone 1 fractures are equivalent (78). In cases of delayed symptomatic presentation, excision of the involved proximal fragment is indicated (86). In our practice, it is very rare that we operatively treat Zone 1 fractures, either displaced or undisplaced. Even if the fracture does not 'heal' radiographically, a pain-free fibrous union may develop, hence making an operation unnecessary (Fig. 3). Poor outcomes are rare and may be attributed to either a painful fibrous union, joint incongruity, or entrapment of the sural nerve branch inside the callus (86)."

    "text": "Optimal management of these fractures is controversial and treatment is individualized to patient's needs and expectations. One of the problems is that the term 'Jones fracture' has been inconsistently used to include both Zone 2 and Zone 3 fractures (49, 87). In general, the 'true Jones' fractures should be treated with non-weight-bearing, as weight-bearing has been implicated in increased incidence of non-union (54), although there has also been a trend toward 'functional treatment' consisting of full weight-bearing accompanied by full range of motion (49, 50). Several authors have reported successful conservative treatment (50, 88, 89). However, because of the watershed area of the region, non-union rates of Zones 2 and 3 have been reported to be up to 21% after non-operative management (84, 90, 91, 92). Healing starts from a medial to lateral direction and callus is seen by 6–8 weeks. Where there is absence of callus within this period, a trial of pulsed electromagnetic field therapy may be used with a reported healing union time of 3 months, range 2–4 months (93). Several systematic reviews conclude that surgery results in shorter union times and lower number of delayed union or non-unions (80, 99, 100, 101).\nIntramedullary screw fixation with or without grafting is being widely performed (6, 13, 36, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59) (Fig. 4). To avoid complications such as hardware failure (Fig. 5) and refracture (102), several studies have been conducted to assess the properties a screw should have. The diameter of the screw should be no less than 4.5 mm in order to obtain adequate compression, and the largest screw possible should always be used (97, 103, 104, 105, 106). Regarding the surgical technique for fresh fractures, the patient is placed supine on a radiolucent table with a bolster under the ipsilateral hip and a tourniquet is applied. The entry point is crucial and is classically described as being ‘high and inside'. A guidewire is inserted and advanced into the canal past the fracture and thereafter the cannulated drill was passed over the guidewire. A solid screw is advanced into the canal to achieve excellent fracture compression. In cases of surgery on delayed/non-unions, the incision is made, the fracture site is exposed, sclerosis is taken down, and multiple drill holes are made. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate, as well as autograft, is packed to the non-union site, and subsequently, a solid screw is passed as previously described. \nIn athletes, relatively high refracture rates have been reported, up to 30% (6), and therefore alternative approaches may be adopted such as plate fixation (61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67). This technique may be preferred in cases of a laterally bowed fifth metatarsal or comminuted fractures (112), however further clinical research is needed to better define its role.\nIn our practice, the treatment is individualized. If non-operative treatment is decided, the patient is placed in a short-leg cast, non-weight-bearing for 6 weeks. If the patient is an operative candidate, an intramedullary screw fixation is our usual standard of care. Post-operatively, the patient is placed in a non-weight-bearing splint and cast. At 6 weeks, healing is evaluated and if healed, full weight-bearing is allowed. In cases of delayed union or non-union, the patient undergoes metabolic workup and is subsequently treated operatively with a primary or revision intramedullary screw and bone grafting. For the competitive athlete, CT confirmation of union is warranted prior to return to full play."

Table 1 summarizes the causes of non-union following fifth Metatarsal fractures. Refractures or non-unions may occur up to 12% of the intramedullary screw fixation cases (59, 100). However, the rate of refracture in elite athletes may be as high as 30% for intramedullary screw fixation (6) vs 10.5% for plate fixation (111), in recent studies. Table 2 summarizes the literature assessing the incidence of non-union and subsequent treatment strategy. Possible causes of failure may be technically related, for example inappropriate screw size/biology, failure to simultaneously address causative factors such as pes cavus, as well as secondary to inadequate post-operative protocols. In the past, symptomatic hardware has been reported in up to 30% of intramedullary screw fixation patients with a traditional screw, which is now rare with the use of fracture-specific screws (106) and the authors use them routinely (Fig. 4B). Headless screws are not recommended because of difficulty in removal (108). Plate removal has been reported in up to 31% of cases (111). It is important to note that removal of hardware may create stress risers and extreme caution is warranted especially in the case of athletes in which case it is recommended to occur only after retirement and in the meantime managed by shoe modification (117)."

The intra-osseous blood supply to the fifth metatarsals' greater tuberosity and proximal diaphysis differs. Fractures of the greater tuberosity both at a proximal and distal level have the propensity to heal given the numerous randomly distributed metaphyseal arteries. In contrast, fractures at the proximal metaphysis disrupt the nutrient artery, and hence create the so-called 'avascular region' (10). Considerations of fracture location and potential vascular compromise should therefore always be taken into account and considered in the treatment strategy."

These features account for the increased propensity of delayed union/non-union in the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction. Additionally, two sesamoid bones, the os peroneum and os vesalianum, should be differentiated from fractures. Most importantly, there is a watershed area at the metaphysis-diaphysis junction between the proximal metaphyseal blood supply and the diaphyseal part of the bone supplied by the nutrient artery which is greatly responsible for the highest risk of delayed union/non-union of these fractures. Finally, the sural nerve is very close to the entry point for intramedullary screw fixation and should be identified and protected during reconstructive procedures."

These include isolated gastrocnemius or triceps surae contractures, congenital bone malstructure, and obesity. A recent radiographic analysis showed that a long, straight, narrow fifth metatarsal possesses a greater risk for Jones fracture. Tibia vara, varus hindfoot, forefoot adduction, genu varum heel, and metatarsus adductus have also been associated with increased load to the lateral column."

They usually occur as inversion injuries.\n\nZone 2: Fractures of the metaphyseal-/diaphyseal junction, which extend into the fourth-fifth intermetatarsal facet, distal to the articulation between cuboid and fifth metatarsal base ('Jones' fractures). They occur after indirect adduction force to the fifth metatarsal.\n\nZone 3: Proximal diaphyseal stress fractures, typically located distal to the Lisfranc joint and distal to the fourth-fifth intermetatarsal facet, that is in the proximal 1.5 cm of the metatarsal shaft. They occur from chronic repetitive stress in sports.\n\n'Dancer's fractures': Fractures occurring at the regions distal to Zone 3.

Various surgical techniques exist, with intramedullary screw fixation, tension band constructs, and low-profile plates. In general, surgery is contraindicated in neuropathic feet, presence of vascular insufficiency, and local infection.

Elastic wrapping and weight-bearing as tolerated for a period of 3 weeks is adequate and a hard-sole shoe, short-leg cast, or cam walker boot can also be other options. Historically, surgery was recommended for a displacement greater than 2 mm, or comminution. Involvement of more than one-third of the cubometatarsal joint may require open reduction and screw fixation. In cases of delayed symptomatic presentation, excision of the involved proximal fragment is indicated. Even if the fracture does not 'heal' radiographically, a pain-free fibrous union may develop, hence making an operation unnecessary."

However, because of the watershed area of the region, non-union rates of Zones 2 and 3 have been reported to be up to 21% after non-operative management. Several systematic reviews conclude that surgery results in shorter union times and lower number of delayed union or non-unions. Intramedullary screw fixation with or without grafting is being widely performed. The diameter of the screw should be no less than 4.5 mm. Plate fixation is an alternative, and a cadaveric study showed promising results of plantar-lateral plate fixation. This technique may be preferred in cases of a laterally bowed fifth metatarsal or comminuted fractures."

However, the rate of refracture in elite athletes may be as high as 30% for intramedullary screw fixation vs 10.5% for plate fixation in recent studies. Possible causes of failure may be technically related, for example inappropriate screw size/biology, failure to simultaneously address causative factors such as pes cavus, as well as secondary to inadequate post-operative protocols. Symptomatic hardware has been reported in up to 30% of intramedullary screw fixation patients with a traditional screw, which is now rare with the use of fracture-specific screws.
