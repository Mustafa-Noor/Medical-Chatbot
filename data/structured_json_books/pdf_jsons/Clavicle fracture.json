The common symptoms following this type of fracture include: Pain straight after the injury, Swelling, Bruising, Difficulty moving the arm, Deformity at the site of injury."

Wear the sling during the day but remove it for exercises and personal hygiene. You can wear it at night time if you find it more comfortable but you don't have to. As your pain improves, you will be able to move your arm more comfortably. You will be given an appointment to return to fracture clinic for follow up if needed. Occasionally, a collarbone fracture requires surgery. If this is the case with your injury, the treating team will discuss this with you."

However, it may take several months for your symptoms to settle completely – these can include pain or discomfort, stiffness, decreased strength and swelling. The bones may take longer to heal if you suffer from diabetes or if you smoke. Once the fracture has healed you may have a ‘bump' where the bone was fractured. For advice on stopping smoking please visit www.nhs.uk/smokefree or discuss this with your GP. Once the fracture has started to heal some people might be referred to their local physiotherapy department for assessment, advice and rehabilitation."

Sling advice: You may be given a sling to wear for comfort during the day for up to 2 weeks. At night you can use pillows to help support the arm for comfort.

Washing and Dressing: When getting washed and dressed you will need to remove your sling. You need to avoid lifting your arm above shoulder height for approximately 6 weeks. You will find it easier and less painful to undress your injured arm last and to dress the injured arm first. When you are washed and dressed you will need to reapply your sling."

    "text": "The majority of systematic reviews and meta-analyses conclude that operatively treated fractures have lower nonunion and malunion rates, but functional outcomes are the same at six months for fractures that unite. The key is identifying patients who may do worse with nonoperative management. An algorithm is proposed for treating displaced MSCFs, considering risk factors, displacement controversies, and patient factors. For patients under 18, nonoperative management is recommended. For those over 18, risk factors for nonunion should be discussed, and operative intervention may be offered. Shortening alone is not an indication for surgery. Patients should be reassessed at six weeks."

Weeks since Injury: 6-12, Rehabilitation plan: The fracture should be largely united (healed) and you can resume normal activity but be governed by any pain you are experiencing. You should be able to carry out day to day activities although arduous tasks may cause discomfort. Start to lift your arm over-head.
