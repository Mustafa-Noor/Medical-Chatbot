In severe cases below knee casts, orthopaedic boots or splints can lead to a faster recovery.\n- Rest – relative rest will allow a natural healing process to occur.\n- Ice – Ice can be used for a maximum of 20 minutes at a time every few hours to help reduce the inflammation and control the pain. Be sure to place a thin towel between the ice and skin to prevent ice burn. If you use a bag of frozen food, do not eat it after refreezing.\n- Compression – Bandages or tubi-grip can help to reduce the swelling. It should be snug but not too tight. Wear it from first thing in the morning to prevent swelling building up during the day. Remove it at night or while resting with the foot elevated.\n- Elevation – raising the ankle above the knee and the knee above the hip will help to reduce swelling."

We encourage you to begin weaning yourself from the support after two to three weeks.\n- Relative rest: reduce activities that are making your symptoms worse.\n- Painkillers: pain relief can help manage the discomfort in the short term. Normally painkillers bought from a pharmacist will work.\n- Footwear: supportive footwear or shoes with a small heel can help reduce the pain in the early stages.\n- Exercise: you should complete specific exercises that aim to increase the strength and stability of your ankle."

    "text": "The initial treatment in the first few days after a sprain aims to settle down the pain and swelling by resting, applying ice packs, taking regular painkillers and elevating the ankle. It is important to remember that early weight bearing aids a quicker recovery. It is also important to keep the ankle moving to prevent stiffness. If you smoke, you are advised to stop as smoking can slow down healing."

    "text": "Sometimes A&E and minor injuries departments will give a “walker boot” to people with sprained ankles. This may help initially with the pain, but it is important to not become reliant on this boot as this will make the ankle weaker and stiffer in the longer term. The boot should be removed at regular intervals and discarded as soon as it's no longer helping. Keep yourself hydrated and mobile as reduced mobility from ankle sprains can increase the risk of a blood clot in the leg or chest. Symptoms such as leg pain or swelling, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, chest pain or feeling faint require you to attend A&E urgently."

In addition to aiding recovery after a sprain, these exercises also help to minimise recurrent sprains occurring. It is important you do these exercises that have been advised. You will usually be referred to physiotherapy for their expert input."

X-rays only show up bone injuries but they cannot show cartilage, scar tissue or the ligaments. Therefore, it is important that if you are having ongoing problems after 6 – 8 weeks that you contact us as you may require further tests to assess the cartilage or ligaments. Very occasionally some people will need surgery to address these problems. However, the vast majority of people will not need further tests or surgery."

Return to work should be guided by your symptom level and what your job involves, for example, manual workers may need more time off work than admin workers due to the nature of their job. In terms of driving, it is your responsibility to ensure you are fit to drive and are able to fully control your car before you return to driving.

    "subtopic": "Summary",
    "text": "Ankle sprains are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries. A sprain is defined as the stretching or tearing of ligaments; in the ankle these are the lateral ligamentous complex, deltoid ligament and distal tibiofibular syndesmosis ligaments. The mechanism of injury dictates which ligaments get injured, with the most common being inversion injuries causing anterior talofibular ligamentous sprain. Initial management of an ankle sprain consists of protection, rest, ice, compression and elevation. After the first 72 hours, the treatment depends on the severity of the sprain, with physiotherapy forming the mainstay of treatment in the majority of cases. In addition to strengthening exercises proprioceptive re-training helps with rehabilitation. The goal of treatment is to prevent chronic instability from occurring. Aside from syndesmotic injuries, surgical treatment is rarely required in the acute setting. Delayed ligamentous reconstruction may be required if chronic instability occurs. This article reviews the anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical assessment and management of patients with ankle sprains."

This can potentially lead to ankle instability. Ankle sprains are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries. The incidence is highest in males aged 10-19 years, but women older than 30 sustain more sprains than their male counterparts. Ankle sprains are more common in physically active individuals, such as athletes. They are known to account for 45% of injuries during basketball and 31% during football. In the UK, it is estimated that 302,000 new ankle sprains and 42,000 new severe ankle sprain patients attend accident and emergency departments every year."
