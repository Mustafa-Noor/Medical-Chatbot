    "text": "You have sustained a fracture to your clavicle (collar bone). In adults, this normally takes between 6-12 weeks to heal. You may use the arm in the meantime as explained in the protocol and indeed it is important to keep the shoulder moving to prevent stiffness but not to aggravate it. Please keep the sling provided on for the first two weeks to allow the soft tissues to settle. Follow the management plan outlined below. Take pain killers as required. You may find it more comfortable to sleep propped up with pillows. If you are worried that you are unable to follow this rehabilitation plan, or have any questions, then please contact the Fracture Care Team for advice."

    "text": "If you are experiencing pain or symptoms, other than at the site of the original injury or surrounding area, please get in touch using the telephone number at the top of this letter. You will have an appointment in the fracture clinic. During this consultation you may have another x-ray to evaluate the position of the clavicle and guide further management. A few very displaced fractures are fixed with an operation if they might not join (non-union). There are risks with operating (such as damage to other structures or problems with metalwork). The Consultant, Specialist, Registrar or Practitioner will talk with you about the options and guide you through the next stage of your rehabilitation."

If you have been advised to do so at your follow-up clinic, you may start to discard the sling and begin normal light activities with your arm and shoulder. It is your choice if you wish to wear it at night. Start the Initial exercises. Do not lift your elbow above shoulder height as this may be painful. Weeks since Injury: 3-6, Rehabilitation plan: Increase movement as shown in the Stage 2 exercises. You should avoid heavy lifting for the full 6 weeks. Weeks since Injury: 6-12, Rehabilitation plan: The fracture should be largely united (healed) and you can resume normal activity but be governed by any pain you are experiencing. You should be able to carry out day to day activities although arduous tasks may cause discomfort. Start to lift your arm over-head. Weeks since Injury: 12, Rehabilitation plan: If you are still experiencing significant pain and stiffness then please contact us for further consultation."

It is important that you consider this information with relation to your recent injury. Stopping smoking during the healing phase of your fracture will help ensure optimal recovery from this injury.

    "text": "If you have stiffness in your elbow or hand from wearing the sling, you may wish to perform these exercises first. However, once they become easy you can start with the posture and pendulum exercises. Elbow Bend to Straighten: Bend and straighten your elbow so you feel a mild to moderate stretch. You can use your other arm to assist if necessary. Do not push into pain. Forearm Rotations: Put your elbow at your side. Bend it to 90 degrees. Slowly rotate your palm up and down until you feel a mild to moderate stretch. You can use your other arm to assist if necessary. Do not push into pain. Repeat 10-15 times provided there is no increase in symptoms. Finger and wrist flexion and extension: Open and close your hand as shown 10-15 times. Then move your wrist up and down 10-15 times. After a few days, hold a soft ball/ball of socks. Squeeze the ball as hard as possible without pain. Hold for 5 seconds and repeat 10 times."

Use your unaffected arm to push the hand on your injured arm outwards. Remember to keep your elbow tucked in. Push until you feel a stretch. If you don't have a stick, you could simply hold the injured arm at the wrist and guide it outwards. Hold for 5 seconds then return to the starting position.

Then when you have regained your full range of movement without the support of the other arm you can start to build up your regular activities. Active Forward flexion: With your thumb facing up, try to move your arm up, keeping it close beside your body. Active Abduction: With your thumb facing up and outwards, try to move your arm in a big arc out to the side. Active External rotation: With your elbow by your side, rotate your forearm outwards, keeping your elbow at about 90 degrees in flexion. Repeat all of these 3 exercises 10 times each, 4-5 times a day. Only go as far as you can naturally, without doing any trick movements to try and get further. This will increase over time and should not be forced."
