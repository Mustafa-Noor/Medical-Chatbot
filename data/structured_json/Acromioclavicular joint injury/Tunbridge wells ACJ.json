    "text": "You have sustained an injury to your acromioclavicular joint (ACJ). This normally takes between three to six weeks to heal, but soft tissue injuries can persist for up to three months. Use the sling (if provided) for up to three weeks and for comfort only. You may use the arm in the meantime; it is important to keep the shoulder moving to prevent stiffness but not to aggravate it. Follow the management/rehabilitation plan outlined below."
