    "text": "A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science and Embase in March 2024. We selected studies comparing surgical and conservative treatment in acute Rockwood III ACJ dislocations. The two treatment methods were compared in terms of Constant score; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH); American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score; Acromioclavicular Joint Instability Score (ACJIS); subjective shoulder value (SSV); radiographical findings; reported complications; and return to sports activity. The risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed using Cochrane guidelines."

    "subtopic": "Prevalence and Classification",
    "text": "Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) dislocation typically occurs in young adult athletes and is one of the most common injuries in the shoulder region, with an incidence ranging from 4 to 12%. Its absolute incidence is approximately 3-4 cases per 100,000 people per year (1). The classification most frequently used to describe this type of injury is the one proposed by Rockwood in 1984, which identifies six grades based on the severity of dislocation, the position of the clavicle and the ligaments involved in the trauma (2)."

    "subtopic": "Treatment Background by Rockwood Type",
    "text": "Rockwood type I and II injuries are characterized by the absence of complete dislocation of the joint and are therefore treated conservatively yielding excellent functional outcomes (3). However, for Rockwood type IV, V and VI injuries, which involve complete dislocation of the ACJ with marked joint instability, surgical treatment is generally preferred (4). Subject to debate is the most appropriate management of Rockwood type III dislocations. These injuries are characterized by complete rupture of the acromioclavicular (AC) and coracoclavicular (CC) ligament complex, causing instability of the ACJ in the vertical plane and potentially additionally the horizontal plane."

    "text": "To date, the treatment of grade III dislocation is based on the preferences of the surgeon and the patient, and the age and level of sporting activity (5). The scientific literature is controversial and does not highlight the superiority of one treatment over the other. Non-surgical approaches reduce postoperative complications and enable faster recovery and earlier return to work, but some patients may experience persistent pain and shoulder deformity with poor cosmetic results. Surgery, on the other hand, has much higher complication rates but may allow for anatomic restoration of the shoulder girdle and may be more suitable for patients engaged in heavy manual labor or competitive sports (1)."

    "text": "The analysis of clinical scores (Constant, DASH, ASES, SSV) showed no significant difference. However, the ACJIS score showed a statistically significant difference favoring surgery, which could be attributed to the fact that ACJIS heavily weights radiographical and cosmetic evaluation (45% of the score), which are worse in conservatively treated patients. The analysis of radiological data (AC and CC distances) showed significantly better anatomical restoration with surgery. However, the literature is uncertain if this anatomical restoration directly improves clinical results, as some studies show a progressive loss of reduction after surgery without worsening of clinical outcomes."

Surgical treatment had a complication rate of 9.2% (e.g., infections, hardware problems), while conservative treatment had a failure rate of 17.2% (persistence of painful symptoms or deformity requiring surgery). It is difficult to directly compare these different types of complications. Limitations of this meta-analysis include the moderate risk of bias and low quality of evidence in most included studies, the heterogeneity of surgical procedures and rehabilitation protocols, and incomplete reporting on patients who failed conservative treatment. However, the included patient group was homogeneous, strengthening the results."

This meta-analysis highlights a significant difference in terms of radiographical outcomes with the AC distance and CC distance values smaller in the surgical group than in the conservative group. The surgical approach presents some complications, particularly wound infections and hardware mobilization/intolerance, with a rate of 9.2%; on the other hand, the conservative group presented a rate of failure of 22%, with risks of persistent instability and pain."
