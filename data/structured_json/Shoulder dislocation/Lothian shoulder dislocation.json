    "subtopic": "Definition and Causes",
    "text": "The shoulder is made up of a ball and socket joint where the ball sits in a very shallow socket. This allows the arm to be very mobile but also makes it one of the easiest joints to dislocate. A dislocated shoulder happens when the bone in your upper arm moves partially or fully out of the shoulder socket. This normally happens from a fall on your arm, commonly during contact sports. In younger people with very flexible joints, this can happen more easily. Sometimes the shoulder will pop back into place by itself, but sometimes help from a paramedic or in the ED is needed. Dislocations can lead to pain, swelling, and bruising for a few weeks."

    "subtopic": "PEACE and LOVE Principles",
    "text": "Immediately after a shoulder subluxation, it is important to manage it correctly by keeping the shoulder gently moving and trying to reduce pain and swelling. The current guidance follows the PEACE and LOVE principles:\n- P (Protection): Avoid activities that increase pain for the first few days.\n- E (Elevation): Elevate the injured limb higher than the heart.\n- A (Avoid Anti-inflammatories): Avoid anti-inflammatory medications as they can reduce tissue healing.\n- C (Compression): Use elastic bandage or taping to reduce swelling.\n- E (Education): Trust your body's healing process and avoid unnecessary passive treatments.\n- L (Load): Let pain guide your gradual return to normal activities.\n- O (Optimism): Be confident and positive for optimal recovery.\n- V (Vascularisation): Choose pain-free cardiovascular activities to increase blood flow.\n- E (Exercise): Restore mobility, strength, and proprioception with an active approach."
