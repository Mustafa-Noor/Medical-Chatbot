    "subtopic": "Definition and Mechanism",
    "text": "A wrist fracture is a break in the radius bone, close to the wrist. In medical terms this is called a 'distal radius fracture'. Occasionally a small chip or fracture can occur in the ulna. Fractures happen when a force is applied to a bone that is greater than the strength of the bone. This might depend on the angle at which the force is applied and how the force is generated. Fractures can happen with a fall, while playing sport or exercising, or during a work or road traffic accident."

    "subtopic": "Follow-up and Treatment Options",
    "text": "Following your treatment in A&E the hospital should contact you and give you an appointment to see a specialist in the fracture clinic within two weeks of your injury. Many wrist fractures are successfully treated without surgery. Even in cases where the alignment of the bone fragments is disrupted, the bones can heal without any serious long-term consequences."

    "subtopic": "Factors for Surgical Decision",
    "text": "We look at the following factors to help us decide whether or not a fracture can be managed without surgery:\n1. The nature of the fracture – the location, the number of bone fragments, if it is an open fracture where skin is broken and the alignment and stability of the fracture\n2. The possible treatment strategies, including non-surgical and surgical options and the rehabilitation that is required\n3. Whether you use your right or left hand\n4. Your general health\n5. Your occupation and recreational activities"

    "subtopic": "Care with and without surgery",
    "text": "If surgery is not required, you may still need to protect the fracture during the initial stages of healing with a cast. You usually need to wear this for six weeks. It is important to exercise the fingers and thumb whilst your cast is in place to help avoid stiffness. If you have an operation you will normally be placed in a plaster of Paris cast. You may be referred to hand therapy to have the cast changed to a pre-fabricated brace and to start exercises."

    "topic": "Fracture healing",
    "subtopic": "Timeline and Outcome Factors",
    "text": "It takes approximately six to eight weeks for your bone to heal and another six weeks for the bone to become almost as strong as it was before. Some injuries are more complex with damage to the surrounding ligaments which take longer to heal. It can take between six and twelve months for you to be able to use your hand normally. The final outcome following a hand fracture depends on many factors, including the nature and complexity of the fracture and the treatment you and the hand surgery / therapy team decide on. Early movement can also improve your outcome. However, the greatest factor to influence outcome is usually your body's own response to the injury."

    "subtopic": "Management",
    "text": "Pain and swelling are normal symptoms when you break a bone. To help manage this we recommend keeping your hand raised above heart level. You may use a sling during the day but it is important to remove this regularly and move your elbow and shoulder to stop them from stiffening. At night, use pillows to help keep your hand raised. Basic painkillers and anti-inflammatories like paracetomol or ibuprofen can help manage pain and swelling."

    "text": "Start exercising your fingers, thumb, elbow and shoulder immediately after your cast is applied. It is important to keep these joints moving to stop them from stiffening. Initially it might feel uncomfortable to do these exercises but with regular practice they will become easier and your movement will improve. We recommend you complete the following exercises five times a day and repeat each exercise five times, but you can do more if you feel able to."
