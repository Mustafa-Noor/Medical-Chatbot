    "text": "This leaflet has been designed to inform you about your spinal fracture(s). It is aimed to help explain how your fracture will be treated, guide your recovery and answer some common questions. It should be read alongside the information your consultant gives you.

    "topic": "What is a vertebral fracture?",
    "subtopic": "Definition",
    "text": "A vertebral fracture is a break to one of the bones in your spine. Your spine runs from the base of your skull to your pelvis. Depending on where along your spine you have fractured and the number of spinal fractures you have, this will affect where the pain is felt and how you are treated."

    "topic": "How did it happen?",
    "subtopic": "Causes",
    "text": "Your consultant will have discussed the likely cause of your spinal fracture. Most follow a specific injury and you will remember the day it happened. Occasionally, a fracture can occur in your back which you may not be able to pinpoint to a specific injury/event. These fractures happen because your bones are weaker than normal, most commonly because of a condition called osteoporosis. People over 55 are at greater risk of osteoporosis. If you're over 55 years old we should have given you a 'bone health' questionnaire to complete. Your answers are reviewed by our bone health team and they will contact you and your GP."

    "subtopic": "Pain shooting up my spine and into my legs?",
    "text": "Your doctor will have shown you the X-ray image of the fractured vertebra(s). What the X-ray doesn't show are the muscles, ligaments and nerves that also get bruised or injured by the force that led to your vertebra fracturing. Injured muscles and ligaments can cause â€œspasm\" pains that shoot in all directions. If the nerves are bruised you may get some temporary pain or numbness felt in your buttock and leg(s). These symptoms should get better within a few weeks. If symptoms get worse you must seek medical review."

    "topic": "Symptoms",
    "subtopic": "Are there new symptoms I should be worried about?",
    "text": "In the majority of people spinal fractures heal without complication. Very occasionally the broken bone fragments can press on the spinal cord or lower spinal nerves and produce leg numbness and pain. These symptoms should improve. Very occasionally the nerves are more affected and you may notice lower leg weakness. Sometimes the nerves supplying your bladder and bowel may also be affected causing numb genitals or incontinence. If this happens you must return to the Emergency Department for urgent review."

  {
    "heading": "Spinal fractures",
    "topic": "Conservative treatment",
    "subtopic": "Explanation and Pain Management",
    "text": "The majority of vertebral fractures are treated conservatively. This means allowing the bone to heal naturally without a specific brace or surgery. Vertebral fractures are painful. Unlike other broken bones, the spine cannot be easily splinted. Standing and sitting put weight across the fractured vertebra, causing pain during the healing period, which often takes three to four months, with the majority of pain settling by six to eight weeks. Regular pain killers are suggested. Paracetamol and Ibuprofen are good painkillers. Codeine or Tramadol can be added if needed. Low dose Diazepam can be helpful for short periods for muscle spasms. Pain killers can cause constipation, so a healthy diet is important."

    "topic": "Spinal brace",
    "subtopic": "Types and Use",
    "text": "Some fractures may be helped by a supportive brace. There are several different types, including Cervical Thoracic Lumbar Sacral Orthosis (CTLSO), Thoracic Lumbar Sacral Orthosis (TLSO), and Lumbar Sacral Orthosis (LSO). A member of the spinal team will show you how to fit the brace. It is important to check your skin daily for pressure ulcers. Wearing a cotton t-shirt under the brace can help. How long you need the brace is guided by your consultant."
